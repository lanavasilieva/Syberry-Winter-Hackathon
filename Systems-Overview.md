### Systems Overview

*1. Dog Sitters Business Owner*
This is a request from an owner of a small business. She is in strong need of having a web app to manage her employees and to connect them with potential clients.
The idea is simple: she needs a system, where either client, employee, or an admin can log in. The Client can view available dog sitters in her area, their experience, rating, and reviews from other Clients. She can choose a sitter, choose a time and a date where the sitter can come in to take a dog for a walk, add an address, and a payment option.
The Sitter can add info for her experience and any information about her. The Sitter can leave a comment about the Client and accept or decline an offer.
The Admin can view everything and manage both Sitters and Clients.
On the log in you can create an account as a client or register as a Sitter.
There may be other features, Development Team can add anything they think will help an Owner to reach their business goal.

*2. Freelance Teacher*
As a freelance teacher, I already used a lot of tools to help me manage my students. I don't have one class, neither am I working in a classic school or university. My classes are online and my students use Zoom.
I have around 40 students, and the number changes from time to time. I need a web app to manage all of them, but I'm not sure of its functionality, I'll just describe my ideas and you can add yours. I need my students to register by the custom link I'm generating (you know, so nobody can register without my permission). Every student must have a personal page with their info, grades, and subjects we're learning. It would be nice to have their parents' contacts and send them a pdf version of the students' grades. 
I would love to send them their homework via this web app. The homework can be either a file (pdf mostly), a file in .md format (maybe you can add a nice feature so I can write in .md and then the app would render the text for me), equations in LaTeX, or something like that, that can render math equations. I want to be able to check their works and leave grades and comments. And I want to leave feedback for each student after their homework.

*3. Local Farmers*
Local Farmers want to bring their community to the client. 
We need a basic web app where each farmer can register, add their products, amount, photos, and prices, and find their clients.
We need to have the main page where every product from every farmer is shown, but the best farmers (based on reviews and products quality) have priority and first numbers on this page. 
Every now and then we want to make something we call Farmers' Collaboration: a collection of products from several different farmers. This Collaboration is sold in one piece, and it collects products from 3 to 7 registered farmers.
Our Clients need not to register, but we need to have a nice cart added to the app, so anybody can buy from us! Add their address, date and time when they are available for delivery, delivery type, and payment option.
Every Client and Farmer can leave a review to other Farmers of their products.
Any other suggestions are most welcome!
